Based on the most indicatives adjectives for each rating star found in the previous part. We develop an application to identify the good and bad features of a business. Taking in a user input for the business id, the application will print out the list of good features and bad features of the particular business. This is done by first, making lists of adjectives with positive connotation and negative connotation. We also make another list containing negative words that negates the meaning of an adjective, such as no, not, never, none. The following shows the result of running the application.
