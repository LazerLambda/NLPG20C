	\begin{abstract}
		Our task covered data processing on a dataset provided by the review platform \textit{yelp}. We had to analyze the data
		descriptively and we had to focus on the Adjectives in the reports. Therefore we had to compare different methods on how the reviews can be represented by adjectives, which also became our application model. In our application model we were able to find specific properties of the business reviewed in the data.

	\subsection{Writing Style}
	For the sentence segmentation we used the library spacy. Each category is displayed in the graph below.
	\begin{center}
		\begin{table}[!h]
			\caption{Average length of the sentences in the different star categories}
			\begin{tabular}{ c c c c c}
				1 Star & 2 Star & 3 Star  & 4 Star & 5 Star\\
				30.5 & 25.9 & 24.0  & 25 & 24\\
			\end{tabular}
		\end{table}
	\end{center}
	
	\begin{figure}
		\caption{Histograms of the length of the sentences}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/1stars-Sentencelength.png}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/2stars-Sentencelength.png}

		\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/4stars-Sentencelength.png}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/5stars-Sentencelength.png}
	\end{figure}
	As can be seen, the length of sentences is on average longer with a poor rating than with a good rating.
