	\begin{abstract}
		Our task covered data processing on a dataset provided by the review platform \textit{yelp}. We had to analyze the data
		descriptively and we had to focus on the Adjectives in the reports. Therefore we had to compare different methods on how the reviews can be represented by adjectives, which also became our application model. In our application model we were able to find specific properties of the businesses reviewed in the data.
